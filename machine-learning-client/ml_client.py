    Analyze the sentiment of a given text using a RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model.

        text (str): The input text to analyze.

        dict[str, float]: A dictionary containing sentiment probabilities ('negative', 'neutral', 'positive') 
                          and a 'composite_score' ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates strong negativity 
                          and 5 indicates strong positivity.
